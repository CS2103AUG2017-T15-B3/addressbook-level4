== Project: The Myth's Book
The Myth’s Book is an address book dedicated for university students to store useful information such as websites, phone numbers and emails of the people around them for personal usage. The application helps students to keep track of birthday dates and upcoming events through a calendar and facilitate convenient access to their friend’s website and even Google Maps location through the in-built browser panel in the application. Furthermore, there are many useful tools such as finding group tags (e.g. friends, neighbours) and switching themes for better user preference and usability.

The Myth’s Book is a Command Line Input based software which helps caters to students who are efficient and comfortable in typing out command line inputs to manipulate with information of their contacts in the address book. The Myth’s Book is a software application that is coded in Java programming language.

=== Enhancement Added: Modified find Command (V1.0)

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Modifying the find command was necessary as my teammates and I found it unfriendly that we could'nt search for a part of somebody's name. Since we fit into the same category as our target users we thought the users would feel the same.

I designed it so that the search only works if the substring is 2 characters or longer.As searching for one character might
not filter out anybody in The Myth's Book at all.


==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Birthday Field (V1.1)

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

It was the first part of a two part modification. For university students, storing of birthdays would be a valuable addition. This would also help me implement reminders for birthdays in the later versions of the application.

=== Enhancement Added: Details Panel (V1.2)

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=details]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
The team decided to reduce the amount of information shown on the person card as it seemed too cluttered
==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---
=== Enhancement Added: Birthdays Command (V1.3)

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=reminder]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Made a birthday reminder so that university students can check if their friend's have birthdays today. This is a rather useful feature for students as they usually celebrate birthdays.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=birthday]

#End of Extract#

---
=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `remark`

{Explain similar to the Undo/Redo feature above.}
