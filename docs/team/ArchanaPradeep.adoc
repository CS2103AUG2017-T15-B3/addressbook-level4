=== Enhancement Added: Modified find Command (V1.0)

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Modifying the find command was necessary as my teammates and I found it unfriendly that we could'nt search for a part
of somebody's name. Since we fit into the same category as our target users we thought the users would feel the same.

I designed it so that the search only works if the substring is 2 characters or longer.As searching for one character might
not filter out anybody in The Myth's Book at all.


==== Implementation

=== Enhancement Added: Birthday Field (V1.1)

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=find]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

It was the first part of a two part modification. For university students, storing of birthdays would be a valuable addition. This
would also help me implement reminders for birthdays in the later versions of the application.

=== Enhancement Added: Details Panel (V1.2)

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=details]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification
The team decided to reduce the amount of information shown on the person card as it seemed too cluttered
==== Implementation

#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

#End of Extract#

=== Enhancement Added: Birthdays Command (V1.3)

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=reminder]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

Made a birthday reminder so that university students can check if their friend's have birthdays today. This is
a rather useful feature for students as they usually celebrate birthdays.

==== Implementation

---
#Start of Extract [from: Developer Guide]#

include::../DeveloperGuide.adoc[tag=birthday]

#End of Extract#

---
=== Enhancement Proposed: Add command `remark`

{Explain similar to the Undo/Redo feature above.}
