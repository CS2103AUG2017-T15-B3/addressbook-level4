== Purpose

This project portfolio displays the contributions and enhancements made to the software, The Myth's Book,
along with its justifications. The portfolio will first introduce The Myth's Book and subsequently talk
about the enhancements and contributions made by Darren Chin.

== Project: The Myth's Book
The Myth's Book is an address book dedicated for university students to store useful information such
as websites, phone numbers and emails of the people around them for personal usage. The application helps students
to keep track of birthday dates and upcoming events through a calendar and facilitate convenient access to their friend's website
and even Google Maps location through the in-built browser panel in the application. Furthermore, there are many
useful tools such as finding group tags (e.g. friends, neighbours) and switching themes for better user preference and usability.

The Myth's Book is a `Command Line Input` based software which helps caters to students who are efficient and comfortable
in typing out command line inputs to manipulate with information of their contacts in the address book.
The Myth's Book is a software application that is coded in `Java` programming language.

=== Enhancement Added: Sort Command, Sort Names Alphabetically

This section includes the behaviour and justification of the sort command and explains how it is implemented.

Code on GitHub: Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/46[#46]

==== External behavior

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=sort]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

University students are often very particular about the way things are organized around them and
the `Sort Command` helps to organize the contacts list of The Myth's Book by sorting the contacts based
on their names alphabetically. Therefore, this contributes to the aspect of user friendliness and allows
users to be able to look through the overall contacts list in an orderly manner whenever needed with better user-readability.

=== Enhancement Added: Access Command, Accessing a website of a contact

This section includes the behaviour and justification of the `Access Command` and explains how it is implemented.

#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=access]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

University students are often very particular about convenience in using software programs and
the `Access Command` allows users to be able to access the website of a contact through the in-built browser panel which
 eliminates tediousness and helps to facilitate ease of accessing websites for users. The command also helps users to avoid opening other programs and avoid switching
between programs so as to facilitate user-friendliness and create an `all-in-one` platform in The Myth's Book.

=== Enhancement Added: Optional fields for Add Command

This section includes the behaviour and justification of the tweaking of `AddCommand` and explains how it is implemented.

Code on GitHub: Pull requests https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/99[#99], https://github.com/CS2103AUG2017-T15-B3/main/pull/96[#96]

==== External behavior

---
#Start of Extract [from: User Guide]#

include::../UserGuide.adoc[tag=add]

#End of Extract#

---

==== Justification

The `AddCommand` can take in `9` different fields (name, phone, email, school email, home number,
website, birthday, address, tags) which is a lot of information required for users to fill in
if all were necessary to fill in in order to add a contact.
Furthermore, University students are often very particular about convenience
in using software programs and it is not realistically possible for users to attain every
piece of information from a contact when adding a contact.
The implementation of optional fields when adding a contact allows users to only need the
name, phone and email of a person and be able to add contacts with ease.
The enhancement also helps to facilitate user-friendliness in using The Myth's Book.

---

==== Implementation

---
The implementation of making fields optional for `AddCommand` allows users to add contacts with lesser
information required as it only requires name,phone,email to add a contact and other fields can be
optionally added together into the input of adding a contact. The implementation is mostly done in the`Model` and `Logic` component.

Suppose a user would like to add a new contact with an address to The Myth's Book and executes the `AddCommand`
by typing `add n/Adam Bait e/adambait@example.com p/98123414 a/18 Taiseng`.

The execution of `AddCommand` is processed in this way:

. User will input `add n/Adam Bait e/adambait@example.com p/98123414 a/18 Taiseng`.
. Input of user will be handled by the `LogicManager` and parse as an argument through the `AddressBookParser` and `AddCommandParser`.
. `AddCommandParser` will check for all the prefixes inputted and the existence of compulsory prefixes required.
. As `Name`,`Phone`,`Email` fields are necessary fields, they are handled as per normal in the `parse` method of `AddCommandParser`
after being checked that the user has inputted the correct prefixes and information for the 3 necessary fields.
. For the `Address` field which are similar to other optional fields, it tests whether user has inputted
the address field or not in `parse` method of `AddCommandParser` and `parseAddress` method of `ParserUtil.java`.
. Based on whether the user has inputted the optional `Address` field, it is handled either by
assigning it with the inputted and validated string of address or assigning it with a
temporary string variable as seen from `Address` constructor of `Address.java`.
. Once all information inputted is handled, user's inputted contact will be successfully added into The Myth's Book.

Code of `parse` method inside `AddCommandParser.java`:

public AddCommand parse(String args) throws ParseException {

    Address address;
    // ... method logic ...

    ArgumentMultimap argMultimap =
            ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize(args, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_PHONE, PREFIX_HOME_NUMBER,
                    PREFIX_EMAIL, PREFIX_ADDRESS, PREFIX_WEBSITE, PREFIX_SCH_EMAIL,
                    PREFIX_BIRTHDAY, PREFIX_TAG);

    if (!arePrefixesPresent(argMultimap, PREFIX_NAME, PREFIX_PHONE, PREFIX_EMAIL)) {
        throw new ParseException(String.format(MESSAGE_INVALID_COMMAND_FORMAT, AddCommand.MESSAGE_USAGE));
    }

    try {
        Name name = ParserUtil.parseName(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_NAME)).get();
        Phone phone = ParserUtil.parsePhone(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_PHONE)).get();
        Email email = ParserUtil.parseEmail(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_EMAIL)).get();

        // ... method logic ...

        Optional<Address> tempAddress = ParserUtil.parseAddress(argMultimap.getValue(PREFIX_ADDRESS));
        address = (tempAddress.isPresent()) ? tempAddress.get() : new Address(null);

        // ... method logic ...

        ReadOnlyPerson person = new Person(name, phone, homeNumber,
             email, schEmail, website, address, birthday, false, tagList);

        return new AddCommand(person);
    } catch (IllegalValueException ive) {
        throw new ParseException(ive.getMessage(), ive);
    }
}

public static Optional<Address> parseAddress(Optional<String> address) throws IllegalValueException {
    return address.isPresent() ? Optional.of(new Address(address.get())) : Optional.empty();
}
----

Code of `Address` constructor inside `Address.java`:

public Address(String address) throws IllegalValueException {
    if (address == null) {
        this.value = ADDRESS_TEMPORARY;
    } else {
        if (!isValidAddress(address)) {
            throw new IllegalValueException(MESSAGE_ADDRESS_CONSTRAINTS);
        }
        this.value = address;
    }

==== Justification

The implementation of capitalizing names fully for a contact being added allows users to
be able to view a sorted person list in a more orderly manner(alphabetically and lexicographically)
in The Myth's Book.

Code of `toCapitalized` method inside `Name.java`:
[source,java]
----
public static String toCapitalized(String s) {
    final String delimiters = " ";
    StringBuilder newString = new StringBuilder();
    boolean isCapital = true;

    for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
        c = (isCapital) ? Character.toUpperCase(c) : Character.toLowerCase(c);
        newString.append(c);

        isCapital = (delimiters.indexOf((int) c) >= 0);
    }
    return newString.toString();
}
